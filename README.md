# AutoCommands

This plugin stores a list of commands (under DefaultEngine.ini) to run in Unreal's default console. It runs each command after first engine tick.

This was inspired by a [forum post](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/ability-to-set-maxfps-as-standard-in-the-editor/7367/8) of people trying to have certain variables set by default in the editor instead of having to manually set them each time.

This has been tested in versions 4.24, 4.27, and 5.1
